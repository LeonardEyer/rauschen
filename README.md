Realtime adaptive filtering for modular synthesis using a teensy

## Getting Started

Fetch this repository using ```git clone ```

### Prerequisites

* Teensy 3.1 or newer

* Matching teensy audio shield

* Connect teensy via USB

* [Install](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) PIO

### Building the Filter

Check the [schematics](hardware/Filter_V0.2.sch)

<!-- ### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo -->

<!-- ## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system -->

<!-- ### Break down into end to end tests
